# One-Item-One-Code Label Generation

## Features

CaoLiao offers bulk QR code generation and label production capabilities, enabling integration with enterprise internal systems as a component of digital infrastructure. After connecting with CaoLiao's Label API, **you can batch generate QR code labels directly within your own systems or webpages**, eliminating the need for data export/import to our platform for bulk generation â€“ a more efficient workflow.

Example integrations include product management, asset tracking, or traceability systems. When new data entries are created, the system can automatically assemble label URLs based on predefined rules to generate corresponding product/asset labels for download and printing.

## API Implementation Methods

### Using Private Templates

Ideal for calling pre-saved label templates under your account, such as customized templates with company logos, background colors, or field configurations based on CaoLiao's public templates.

Navigate to "Label Templates" in your workbench, select a saved template, access its details page, and enable "API Integration". During calls, pass different parameter values as needed to generate varied label images in bulk.

## Case Studies

### 1. Third-Party Developer: Feishu Multi-Dimensional Tables Integration

Developers can use CaoLiao's Label API to create plugins that integrate batch QR label generation into external software.

Example: Developer Ryan Cui created a "CaoLiao QR Code" plugin for Feishu Multi-Dimensional Tables using our API. Users can select templates and map fields directly within Feishu, automatically triggering label generation via our API. [Learn more](https://cli.im/help/88738)

### 2. Automotive Community: Real-Time Label Generation via Webpage Integration

Existing systems can embed CaoLiao's Label API to auto-generate and display labels when new data is added.

Example: An automotive community platform uses our API to generate QR code labels for WeChat group invitations directly on their webpage, eliminating manual uploads.
