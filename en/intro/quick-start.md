## Suitable Scenarios

CaoLiao provides a standardized, lightweight solution centered on QR codes. Its advantages lie in simplicity, low cost, and rapid deployment, making it ideal for basic information management of items or personnel. For example, for company asset management requiring only information viewing and simple updates without complex features, CaoLiao is a suitable choice. Unlike traditional asset management systems, it requires no additional hardware or specialized training—just scan the QR code via WeChat to view or update information.

However, for complex data processing or highly customized needs, CaoLiao may not suffice. In such cases, we recommend seeking more specialized solutions.
