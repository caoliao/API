Taking epidemic prevention registration as an example, automatically recognize health codes, synchronize the results to Tencent Docs, and notify abnormal cases in the WeCom group.

> Note: The AI components in Qinglian are currently being upgraded. There are two versions of the same AI applicationâ€”choose the one labeled **V2**, as the other is unavailable.
