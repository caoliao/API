# Feishu Ã— CaoLiao QR Code Plugin

## Features

Based on the [One-Object-One-Code Label API](https://cli.im/help/86460) provided by CaoLiao QR Code, Feishu Multi-dimensional Tables developer Ryan Cui has created the "CaoLiao QR Code" plugin. This plugin enables batch generation of QR code labels within smart tables and is currently in public beta.
