# Import Existing CaoLiao Account Data into Installed WeCom Application

If you have already added the **CaoLiao QR Code** application in WeCom, you can use the **Legacy Account Data Import** feature to import your existing CaoLiao account data into the **WeCom edition**.

## Detailed Import Process

1. Log in using WeCom by scanning the QR code. Click the entry at the bottom of the workbench or on the account information page to proceed.
