3. After successful account binding, **data integration to the WeCom edition will begin automatically**.

## WeCom Edition Pricing Model Adjustment

WeCom adjusted its pricing model on May 16, 2022. Under the new rules, using the CaoLiao QR Code application within WeCom requires payment for WeCom API licenses based on the number of visible range members. See the announcement: [WeCom Edition Pricing Model Adjustment Notice](https://cli.im/help/76366).

- Free version users can use WeCom API for free for 90 days. After 90 days, a WeCom API license purchase is required.
- To access paid features like advanced members, users must pay for the corresponding CaoLiao version (same as the official website) plus additional WeCom API fees.

## FAQs

**1. Why does my paid account display as a free version in WeCom with restricted visible range members?**

If your paid account shows as a free version during integration and limits visible range members to fewer than 50, **ignore the prompt** and continue adding members. After binding, synchronize paid entitlements in WeCom. [View tutorial](https://cli.im/help/69993).

**2. What if I've already added the CaoLiao QR Code application in WeCom and the integration QR code doesn't respond?**

Log out, then select "Log in via WeCom QR code" from the login popup. After logging in, you'll see the **"Import Existing Account Data"** function on the right side of the workbench. [View import tutorial](https://cli.im/help/69625).

**3. Why does scanning the WeCom QR code only show "Recommend to Admin" without the option to add the application?**

This is due to WeCom's policy: organizations with 500+ members cannot directly add third-party applications. You can recommend the application to an admin for addition and configuration. [View tutorial](https://cli.im/help/69676).
