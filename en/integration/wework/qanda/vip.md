# Integrating CaoLiao Paid Benefits into WeCom

If you are currently a paid user of CaoLiao and have integrated it with the WeCom edition, but the CaoLiao QR Code application details page in the WeCom workbench still shows **Free Version**, the application's visible range will be limited to a maximum of 50 users. The version and features displayed on the CaoLiao side remain unaffected.

**This is because WeCom requires that applications exceeding the 50-user limit must complete a payment within WeCom to upgrade to the paid version.**

After discussions with WeCom, we have confirmed the following solution to synchronize the paid benefits of existing CaoLiao users on WeCom without the 50-user restriction.

## Steps

1. The WeCom administrator should log in to the WeCom workbench, navigate to Application Management, locate the CaoLiao QR Code application, and click **Upgrade to Paid Version**.

2. Scroll right to find the `Legacy User Integration` version, priced at 1 RMB. Proceed with the online payment to complete the synchronization of paid benefits on WeCom.

After payment, the WeCom side will display the version as **Legacy User Integration**. Although the name differs from the version name on the CaoLiao side, it will not affect the paid features of your original subscription.

## WeCom Edition Pricing Model Adjustment

WeCom adjusted its pricing model on May 16, 2022. According to the new rules, using the CaoLiao QR Code application in WeCom requires paying a WeCom interface license fee based on the number of members in the visible range. For details, see the announcement: [WeCom Edition Pricing Model Adjustment Notice](https://cli.im/help/76366).

You can select members to add to the visible range of the CaoLiao QR Code application based on your enterprise's needs. This enables members to scan QR codes to fill out forms, view data, and receive notifications directly through WeCom.
